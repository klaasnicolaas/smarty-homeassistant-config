# This file defines the Lovalace Dashboards in my UI.
#
# I would love to split this file, however, I cannot think of a way to make
# this a clear split. For example, there is the Lovelace dashboard declaration
# that goes into the integration settings, but there is also the Lovelace
# dashboard definition, that is the main file for each dashboard.
#
# I choose the route to make this file the declaration, while using the
# dashboard folder in this directory, for the actual definition of the
# dashboards themselves.
