# Smarty - Home Assistant config

**NOTE**: This is not my first [Home Assistant][home-assistant] configuration that you can find on Github. Take also a look at these [Home Assistant configuration repositories][smarthomes].

---

You will probably think, what is Home Assistant!? Well Home Assistant is a open source home automation platform that puts local control and privacy first. Powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts. Perfect to run on a Raspberry Pi or a local server.

Use the code from this repo for your own Home Assistant environment, keep in mind to not always copy everything line-by-line. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them via email or socials!

## Current House Configuration

Some time ago we moved to another part of the country, which also meant the end of the old Home Assistant configuration and a fresh start in the new house. For example, a network infrastructure upgrade with Ubiquiti Unifi hardware for the internet at home and a server cabinet where everything comes together, super cool!

**My Home Assistant Server**

Below my server setup on which I run Home Assistant:

- [Intel Baby Canyon NUC7i5BNH][intel-nuc] - Inside it 16GB RAM and 500GB SSD.
- Running a [Proxmox][proxmox] server, with a [Home Assistant OS][ha-os] VM on it.
- [Aeotec USB Z-Stick][zwave-stick] - Z-Wave Plus
- [Deconz - Conbee II][conbee] stick

**And I use the following hardware in my house:**

- Xiaomi Aqara [Temperature & Humidity Sensors][xiaomi_temp-shop] (Zigbee)
- Xiaomi Aqara [Window Door Sensors][xiaomi_door-shop] (Zigbee)
- [Blitzwolf BW-SHP13][bw_shp13-shop] smart plugs (Zigbee)
- [Blitzwolf BW-SHP2][bw_shp2-shop] smart plugs (ESPHome flashed)
- [Fibaro Wall Plug][fibaro_wall-shop] (Z-Wave)
- [Fibaro Smoke Sensor][fibaro_smoke-shop] (Z-Wave)
- Shelly 1 (ESPHome flashed)
- [Shelly Dimmer 2][shelly_dimmer_2] (Wi-Fi)
- [Shelly 2PM][shelly_2pm] (Wi-Fi)
