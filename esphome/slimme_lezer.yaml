# DSMR Smart Reader (Slimme lezer)
#
# This is a DSMR reader for the P1 port of my Dutch smart meter.
# It is a pre-assemled device from Marcel Zuidwijk, which I can
# highly recommend.

#
# This is my version of the configuration, which has been partly
# contributed back to the original configuration of Marcel.
