# Uptime Timestamp Sensor
#
# This sensor is an alternative for the uptime sensor, which only sends the
# startup timestamp of the device ONCE! Instead of sending updates to
# Home Assistant constantly.
#
# This saves you tons of updates to be processed and, if recorded/stored in the
# Home Assistant database, many many less rows.
#
# This sensor can be triggered manually and will only update the status once!
# This package needs `time/homeassistant.yaml` and `sensor/uptime.yaml` to work.
# See `common/time.yaml` for an example usage.
